# Detecting disease on beans leaves using image classification

Food security is one of the United Nations Sustainable Goals. Yet still there is more than [800 million](https://www.worldometers.info/) undernourished people in the world because of food shortages or inefficient crop yield. 
Early disease detection on plant leaves can reduce the world crop losses.

In this project I looked at `beans` [dataset](https://github.com/AI-Lab-Makerere/ibean), where each image contains bean plants grown on small farms in East Africa. Beans are a staple in many East African cousines and represent a significant source of protein for school-aged children.

Our goal is to help diagnose the health condition of bean crops and **develop a classifier that can predict whether the bean leaves have been affected by a disease or not**. Every image in this dataset is 500-by-500 pixels large and was taken by a smartphone camera on the farm. Also, every image is associated with exactly one condition (healthy, angular leaf spot disease, or bean rust disease).
