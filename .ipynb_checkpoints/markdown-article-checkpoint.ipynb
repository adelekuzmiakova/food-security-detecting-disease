    "## Project setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with any project, it is a good idea to create a [virtual environment](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#2.-create-a-virtual-environment-recommended) to isolate project-specific libraries from the global environment. Python virtual environment stores dependencies required by different projects in separate places by creating virtual environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on TensorFlow version 1.x but Project Y needs 2.x version” dilemma and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable. Create a new virtual environment by running the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "virtualenv -p python3.7 .env        # create a virtual environment (python3.7)\n",
    "source .env/bin/activate            # activate the virtual environment\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt    # install dependencies\n",
    "deactivate                          # exit the virtual environment \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification is the core task in computer vision. The goal of an image classification task is to read an image and **assign one label from a fixed set of categories to it**. Despite its simplicity, image classification has many applications in machine learning, web development, or data science. Additionally, many other computer vision problems, such as object detection or semantic segmentation, can be reduced to image classification.\n",

    "1. Examine the data and build an input pipeline \n",
